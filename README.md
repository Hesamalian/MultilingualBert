## Text Classification with Transformers

This is a [colab](https://github.com/Hesamalian/MultilingualBert/blob/master/MBERTclassification.ipynb) notebook to utilize Keras libraries (https://github.com/vzhou842/cnn-from-scratch) and Simple Transformers (https://github.com/ThilinaRajapakse/simpletransformers) to demonstrate the difference between CNN and Multilingual BERT text classifiers.

The former one is based on transformer package by HuggingFace :hugs: (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
